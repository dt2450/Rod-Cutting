# Rod-Cutting
Various approaches to solve the Rod Cutting Problem

#Problem-Statement
Suppose you have a rod of length n, and you want to cut up the rod and sell the pieces in
a way that maximizes the total amount of money you get. A piece of length i is worth pi
dollars.

For example:

For the Revenue List


length  i|1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
------------------------------------------------
price p i|1   5   8   9  10  17  17  20  24   30

What is the maximum amount that a rod of size 4 will fetch?

Program should output:
1. The maximum amount R that the rod of length n can fetch for a given revenue list
2. A list of size of cuts that need to be made to earn R Dollars.

# Different Approaches to the Problem

1. Recursive Approach

2. Memoization Approach

3. Dynamic Programming Approach
